// TODO write code to identify the currency symbol that has the highest exchange rate compared to Euros.
//    In other words, identify the property with the largest value. the answer is BRL (Brazilian Real) at 3.8959 BRL to 1 Euro.

// TODO write code to print the total number of prize categories
// TODO write code to count the total number of laureates from 2017.
//   have a good look at how the JSON is structured, and think about what loop(s) you'll need to write.
